#  Cloud ETL Data Pipeline

## üîç Overview

Built a robust, automated ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory to extract data from various sources, apply transformations (including filters and joins), and load it into a SQL database. Designed for scalability and monitoring, the pipeline reduces manual data processing, enables real-time updates, and ensures clean, reliable data for analytics teams.
